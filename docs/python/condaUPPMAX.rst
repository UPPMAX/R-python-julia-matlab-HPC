Conda at UPPMAX
===============

.. questions::

   - What does Conda do?
   - How to create a Conda environment
   
.. objectives::

   - Learn pros and cons with Conda
   - Learn how to install packages and work with the Conda (isolated) environment
   
.. hint::

   - On Bianca (with no internet), Conda is the first choice when installing packages, because there is a local mirror of most of the Conda repositories.

Using Conda
-----------
      
.. admonition:: Conda cheat sheet    
   
   - List packages in present environment:	``conda list``
   - List all environments:			``conda info -e`` or ``conda env list``
   - Install a package: ``conda install somepackage``
   - Install from certain channel (conda-forge): ``conda install -c conda-forge somepackage``
   - Install a specific version: ``conda install somepackage=1.2.3``
   - Create a new environment: ``conda create --name myenvironment``
   - Create a new environment from requirements.txt: ``conda create --name myenvironment --file requirements.txt``
   - On e.g. HPC systems where you don’t have write access to central installation directory: conda create --prefix /some/path/to/env``
   - Activate a specific environment: ``conda activate myenvironment``
   - Deactivate current environment: ``conda deactivate``

Install with conda (UPPMAX)
---------------------------

.. Note::

    We have mirrored all major conda repositories directly on UPPMAX, on both Rackham and Bianca. These are updated every third day.
    We have the following channels available:
    
    - bioconda
    - biocore
    - conda-forge
    - dranew
    - free
    - main
    - pro
    - qiime2
    - r
    - r2018.11
    - scilifelab-lts
    
    You reach them all by loading the conda module. You don't have to state the specific channel when using UPPMAX. Otherwise you do with ``conda -c <channel> ...``
    
First steps
-----------

.. tip::
    
   There will be an exercise in the end! 

1. First load our conda module (there is no need to install you own miniconda, for instance)

  .. code-block:: console

     $ module load conda
    
  - This grants you access to the latest version of Conda and all major repositories on all UPPMAX systems.

  - Check the text output as conda is loaded, especially the first time, see below
  
   .. admonition:: Conda load output
          :class: dropdown

       - The variable CONDA_ENVS_PATH contains the location of your environments. Set it to your project's environments folder if you have one.

       - Otherwise, the default is ~/.conda/envs. 

       - You may run ``source conda_init.sh`` to initialise your shell to be able to run ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate`` etc.

       - Just remember that this command adds stuff to your shell outside the scope of the module system.

       - REMEMBER TO ``conda clean -a`` once in a while to remove unused and unnecessary files


2. First time
        
  - The variable CONDA_ENVS_PATH contains the location of your environments. Set it to your project's environments folder if you have one.
  - Otherwise, the default is ~/.conda/envs. 
  - Example:
  
      .. code-block:: console
 
         $ export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/proj/<your-project-id>/nobackup/<username>
  
   .. admonition:: By choice
      :class: dropdown
 
      Run ``source conda_init.sh`` to initialise your shell (bash) to be able to run ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate`` etcetera instead of ``source activate``. It will modify (append) your ``.bashrc`` file.
      
  
   - When conda is loaded you will by default be in the base environment, which works in the same way as other conda environments. include a Python installation and some core system libraries and dependencies of Conda. It is a “best practice” to avoid installing additional packages into your base software environment.


3. Create the conda environment

  - Example:
  
  .. code-block:: console

     $ conda create --name python36-env python=3.6 numpy=1.13.1 matplotlib=2.2.2
	
  .. admonition:: The ``mamba`` alternative 
     :class: dropdown
    
     - ``mamba`` is a fast drop-in alternative to conda, using "libsolv" for dependency resolution. It is available from the ``conda`` module.
     - Example:  
	
     .. code-block:: console

	$ mamba create --name python37-env python=3.7 numpy=1.13.1 matplotlib=2.2.2

4. Activate the conda environment by:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ source activate python36-env

    - You will see that your prompt is changing to start with ``(python-36-env)`` to show that you are within an environment.
    
5. Now do your work!

6. Deactivate

 .. prompt:: 
    :language: bash
    :prompts: (python-36-env) $
    
    conda deactivate

.. warning::
 
    - Conda is known to create **many** *small* files. Your diskspace is not only limited in GB, but also in number of files (typically ``300000`` in $home). 
    - Check your disk usage and quota limit with ``uquota``
    - Do a ``conda clean -a`` once in a while to remove unused and unnecessary files

Working with Conda environments defined by files
------------------------------------------------

- Create an environment based on dependencies given in an environment file:: 

   $ conda env create --file environment.yml
   
- Create file from present conda environment::

   $ conda env export > environment.yml
  

``environments.yml`` (for conda) is a yaml-file which looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: my-environment
   channels:
     - defaults
   dependencies:
     - numpy
     - matplotlib
     - pandas
     - scipy

``environments.yml`` with versions:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: my-environment
    channels:
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python=3.7
      - numpy=1.18.1
      - matplotlib=3.1.3
      - pandas=1.1.2
      - scipy=1.6.2

Exercises
---------

.. challenge:: UPPMAX: Create a conda environment and install some packages
    
   - First check the current installed packages while having ``python/3.9.5`` loaded
   - Open a new terminal and have the old one available for later comparison
   - Use the conda module on Rackham and create an environment with name ``HPC-python23`` with ``python 3.7``  and ``numpy 1.15``
   
   	- Use your a path for ``CONDA_ENVS_PATH`` of your own choice or ``/proj/py-r-jl/<user>/python``
        - (It may take a minute or so)
	
   - Activate!
   - Check with ``pip list`` what is there. Compare with the environment given from the python module in the first terminal window. 
   
   	- Which version of Python did you get?
	
   - Don't forget to deactivate the Conda environment before doing other exercises!

.. solution:: Solution for UPPMAX
    :class: dropdown
    
          Write this in the terminal
          
          .. code-block:: console

            $ module load conda
            $ export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/proj/py-r-jl/<user>/python
            $ conda create --name HPC-python23 python=3.7 numpy=1.15
            $ source activate HPC-python23
            $ pip list
            $ python -V
            $ source deactivate

.. admonition:: Using pip on Bianca

   - Bianca cluster does not have direct internet access
   - If a python package is not not available on Bianca already (like Conda repositories) you may have to use the wharf to install your tools

   - `Install with pip to Bianca <https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshop/pip/>`_

.. keypoints::

   - Conda is an installer of packages but also bigger toolkits
   - Conda creates isolated environments (see next section) not clashing with other installations of python and other versions of packages
   - Conda environment requires that you install all packages needed by yourself. 
   
      - That is, you cannot load the python module and use the packages therein inside you Conda environment.
