   - Learn how to install packages and work with the Conda (isolated) environment



Install with conda (UPPMAX)
---------------------------

.. Note::

    We have mirrored all major conda repositories directly on UPPMAX, on both Rackham and Bianca. These are updated every third day.
    We have the following channels available:
    
    - bioconda
    - biocore
    - conda-forge
    - dranew
    - free
    - main
    - pro
    - qiime2
    - r
    - r2018.11
    - scilifelab-lts
    
    You reach them all by loading the conda module. You don't have to state the specific channel when using UPPMAX. Otherwise you do with ``conda -c <channel> ...``
    
First steps
-----------

1. First load our conda module (there is no need to install you own miniconda, for instance)

  .. prompt:: bash $

        module load conda
    
  - This grants you access to the latest version of Conda and all major repositories on all UPPMAX systems.

  - Check the text output as conda is loaded, especially the first time, see below
  
   .. admonition:: Conda load output
       :class: dropdown

       - The variable CONDA_ENVS_PATH contains the location of your environments. Set it to your project's environments folder if you have one.

       - Otherwise, the default is ~/.conda/envs. 

       - You may run ``source conda_init.sh`` to initialise your shell to be able to run ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate`` etc.

       - Just remember that this command adds stuff to your shell outside the scope of the module system.

       - REMEMBER TO ``conda clean -a`` once in a while to remove unused and unnecessary files


2. First time
        
  - The variable CONDA_ENVS_PATH contains the location of your environments. Set it to your project's environments folder if you have one.
  - Otherwise, the default is ~/.conda/envs. 
  - Example:
  
      .. prompt:: bash $
 
          export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/proj/snic2022-22-641/nobackup/<username>
  
   .. admonition:: By choice
      :class: dropdown
 
      Run ``source conda_init.sh`` to initialise your shell (bash) to be able to run ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate`` etcetera instead of ``source activate``. It will modify (append) your ``.bashrc`` file.
      
Using Conda
-----------
      
.. admonition:: Conda cheat sheet    
   
   - List packages in present environment:	``conda list``
   - List all environments:			``conda info -e`` ot ``conda env list``
   - Install a package: ``conda install somepackage``
   - Install from certain channel (conda-forge): ``conda install -c conda-forge somepackage``
   - Install a specific version: ``conda install somepackage=1.2.3``
   - Create a new environment: ``conda create --name myenvironment``
   - Create a new environment from requirements.txt: ``conda create --name myenvironment --file requirements.txt``
   - On e.g. HPC systems where you don’t have write access to central installation directory: conda create --prefix /some/path/to/env``
   - Activate a specific environment: ``conda activate myenvironment``
   - Deactivate current environment: ``conda deactivate``
   
   - When conda is loaded you will by default be in the base environment, which works in the same way as other conda environments. include a Python installation and some core system libraries and dependencies of Conda. It is a “best practice” to avoid installing additional packages into your base software environment.


3. Create the conda environment

  - Example:
  
    .. prompt:: bash $

        conda create --name python36-env python=3.6 numpy=1.13.1 matplotlib=2.2.2
	
    .. admonition:: The ``mamba`` alternative 
        :class: dropdown
    
	- ``mamba`` is a fast drop-in alternative to conda, using "libsolv" for dependency resolution. It is available from the ``conda`` module.
	- Example:  
	
          .. prompt:: bash $

	      mamba create --name python37-env python=3.7 numpy=1.13.1 matplotlib=2.2.2

4. Activate the conda environment by:

    .. prompt:: bash $

	source activate python36-env

    - You will see that your prompt is changing to start with ``(python-36-env)`` to show that you are within an environment.
    
5. Now do your work!

6. Deactivate

 .. prompt:: 
    :language: bash
    :prompts: (python-36-env) $
    
    conda deactivate

.. warning::
 
    - Conda is known to create **many** *small* files. Your diskspace is not only limited in GB, but also in number of files (typically ``300000`` in $home). 
    - Check your disk usage and quota limit with ``uquota``
    - Do a ``conda clean -a`` once in a while to remove unused and unnecessary files

Working with Conda environments defined by files
------------------------------------------------

- Create an environment based on dependencies given in an environment file ::

   $ conda env create --file environment.yml
   
- Create file from present conda environment::

  $ conda env export > environment.yml
  

``environments.yml`` (for conda) is a yaml-file which looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: my-environment
   channels:
     - defaults
   dependencies:
     - numpy
     - matplotlib
     - pandas
     - scipy

``environments.yml`` with versions:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: my-environment
    channels:
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python=3.7
      - numpy=1.18.1
      - matplotlib=3.1.3
      - pandas=1.1.2
      - scipy=1.6.2

.. keypoints::

   - Conda is an installer of packages but also bigger toolkits
   - Conda creates isolated environments not clashing with other installations of python and other versions of packages
   - Conda environment requires that you install all packges needed by yourself. That is,  you cannot load the python module and use the packages therein inside you Conda environment.
