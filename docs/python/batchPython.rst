Running Python in batch mode
============================

.. questions::

   - What is a batch job?
   - How to make a batch job?

   
   
.. objectives:: 

   - Short introduction to SLURM scheduler
   - Show structure of a batch script
   - Try example

.. admonition:: Compute allocations in this workshop 

   - Rackham: ``naiss2024-22-1202``
   - Kebnekaise: ``hpc2n2024-114``
   - Cosmos:   

.. admonition:: Storage space for this workshop 

   - Rackham: ``/proj/r-py-jl-m-rackham``
   - Kebnekaise: ``/proj/nobackup/r-py-jl-m``
   - Cosmos: 

Any longer, resource-intensive, or parallel jobs must be run through a **batch script**.

The batch system used at UPPMAX, HPC2N, and LUNARC is called SLURM. The same is the case at most of the Swedish HPC centres. 

SLURM is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions

- Keeps track of available system resources
- Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies
- Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies

In order to run a batch job, you need to create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script).

Guides and documentation at: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/intro/ and https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/slurm/  

**Workflow**

- Write a batch script

  - Inside the batch script you need to load the modules you need (Python, Python packages ... )
  - Possibly activate an isolated/virtual environment to access own-installed packages
  - Ask for resources depending on if it is a parallel job or a serial job, if you need GPUs or not, etc.
  - Give the command(s) to your Python script

- Submit batch script with ``sbatch <my-python-script.sh>`` 

Common file extensions for batch scripts are ``.sh`` or ``.batch``, but they are not necessary. You can choose any name and extension that makes sense to you. 

Useful commands to the batch system
-----------------------------------

- Submit job: ``sbatch <jobscript.sh>``
- Get list of your jobs: ``squeue -u <username>``
- Check on a specific job: ``scontrol show job <job-id>``
- Delete a specific job: ``scancel <job-id>``
- Useful info about a job: ``sacct -l -j <job-id> | less -S``
- Url to a page with info about the job (Kebnekaise only): ``job-usage <job-id>``

Here we are using the virtual environment we created under the "isolated environments" session earlier. It is using the Python package "<a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn">seaborn</a>". In order to run the seaborn-code.py example, you need to download the data set "tips.csv" which you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data">https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data</a>. If you want, there are other datasets there to play with. (Note: the data set in question can now also be found in the exercises python section).

   - For parallel computing, you may get an introduction here: (https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/parallel.html)



.. keypoints::

   - The SLURM scheduler handles allocations to the calculation nodes
   - Batch jobs runs without interaction with user
   - A batch script consists of a part with SLURM parameters describing the allocation and a second part describing the actual work within the job, for instance one or several Python scripts.
      
      - Remember to include possible input arguments to the Python script in the batch script.
