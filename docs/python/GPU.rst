Using GPUs with Python
======================

.. questions::

   - What is GPU acceleration?
   - How to enable GPUs (for instance with CUDA) in Python code?
   - How to deploy GPUs at HPC2N, UPPMAX, and LUNARC?
   
   

.. objectives::

   - Learn common schemes for GPU code acceleration
   - Learn about the GPU nodes at HPC2N, UPPMAX, and LUNARC 

GPU-accelerated computing is when you use a graphics processing unit (GPU) along with a computer processing unit (CPU) to facilitate processing-intensive operations such as deep learning, analytics and engineering applications.

A GPU is a processor which is from many smaller and more specialized cores. When these cores work together, you can get a large performance boost for tasks that can be divided up and processed across many cores.

In a typical cluster, some GPUs are attached to a single node resulting in a CPU-GPU
hybrid architecture. The CPU component is called the host and the GPU part the device.

We can characterize the CPU and GPU performance with two quantities: the **latency** and the **throughput**.

**Latency** refers to the time spent in a sole computation. **Throughput** denotes the number of computations that can be performed in parallel. Then, we can say that a CPU has low latency (able to do fast computations) but low throughput (only a few computations simultaneously).
In the case of GPUs, the latency is high and the throughput is also high. We can visualize the behavior of the CPUs and GPUs with cars as in the figure below. A CPU would be compact road where only a few racing cars can drive whereas a GPU would be a broader road where plenty of slow cars can drive.

.. figure:: ../../img/cpu-gpu-highway.png
   :width: 450
   :align: center

Cars and roads analogy for the CPU and GPU behavior. The compact road is analogous to the CPU (low latency, low throughput) and the broader road is analogous to the GPU (high latency, high throughput)

As an illustration a K80 GPU engine looks like this:

.. figure:: ../../img/gpu.png
   :align: center

   A single GPU engine of a K80 card. Each green dot represents a core (single precision) which
   runs at a frequency of 562 MHz. The cores are arranged in slots called streaming multiprocessors (SMX)
   in the figure. Cores in the same SMX share some local and fast cache memory.

In a typical cluster, some GPUs are attached to a single node resulting in a CPU-GPU
hybrid architecture. The CPU component is called the host and the GPU part the device.
One possible layout (Kebnekaise - the K80s are now retired) is as follows:


.. figure:: ../../img/cpu-gpu.png
   :width: 450  
   :align: center

   Schematics of a hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. A GPU K80 card consisting of two engines is attached to a NUMA island which in turn contains 14 cores. The NUMA island and the GPUs are connected through a PCI-E interconnect which makes the data transfer between both components rather slow.

Not every Python program is suitable for GPU acceleration. GPUs process simple functions rapidly, and are best suited for repetitive and highly-parallel computing tasks. GPUs were originally designed to render high-resolution images and video concurrently and fast, but since they can perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data, they are also often used for other, non-graphical tasks. Common uses are machine learning and scientific computation were the GPUs can take advantage of massive parallelism. 

Many Python packages are not CUDA aware, but some have been written specifically with GPUs in mind. 
If you are usually working with for instance NumPy and SciPy, you could optimize your code for GPU computing by using CuPy which mimics most of the NumPy functions. Another option is using Numba, which has bindings to CUDA and lets you write CUDA kernels in Python yourself. This means you can use custom algorithms. 

One of the most common use of GPUs with Python is for machine learning or deep learning. For these cases you would use something like Tensorflow or PyTorch libraries which can handle CPU and GPU processing internally without the programmer needing to do so. 

GPUs on UPPMAX, HPC2N, and LUNARC systems
--------------------------------

There are generally either not GPUs on the login nodes or they cannot be accessed for computations. 
To use them you need to either launch an interactive job or submit a batch job.

**UPPMAX only**

Rackham's compute nodes do not have GPUs. You need to use Snowy for that. A useful module on Snowy is ``python_ML_packages/3.9.5-gpu``.

You need to use this batch command (for x being the number of cards, 1 or 2):

.. code-block::

   #SBATCH -M snowy
   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:x

**HPC2N**

Kebnekaise's GPU nodes are considered a separate resource, and the regular compute nodes do not have GPUs.

Kebnekaise has a great many different types of GPUs:

- V100 (2 cards/node)
- A40 (8 cards/node)
- A6000 (2 cards/node) 
- L40s (2 or 6 cards/node)
- A100 (2 cards/node)
- H100 (4 cards/node)
- MI100 (2 cards/node) 

To access them, you need to use this to the batch system: 

``#SBATCH --gpus=x``

where x is the number of GPU cards you want. Above are given how many are on each type, so you can ask for up to that number. 

In addition, you need to add this to the batch system: 

``#SBATCH -C <type>``

where type is 

- v100
- a40
- a6000
- l40s
- a100
- h100
- mi100 

For more information, see HPC2N's guide to the different parts of the batch system: https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/batchsystem/resources/
   
**LUNARC** 

LUNARC has Nvidia A100 GPUs and Nvidia A40 GPUs, but the latter ones are reserved for interactive graphics work on the on-demand system, and Slurm jobs should not be submitted to them. 

Thus in order to use the A100 GPUs on Cosmos, add this to your batch script: 

A100 GPUs on AMD nodes: 

.. code-block::
  
   #SBATCH -p gpua100
   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1

These nodes are configured as exclusive access and will not be shared between users. User projects will be charged for the entire node (48 cores). A job on a node will also have access to all memory on the node.

A100 GPUs on Intel nodes: 

.. code-block::

   #SBATCH -p gpua100i
   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:<number>

where ``<number>`` is 1 or 2 (Two of the nodes have 1 GPU and two have 2 GPUs). 


Numba example
-------------

Numba is installed on HPC2N and LUNARC as a module. We also need numpy, so we are loading SciPy-bundle as we have done before. 
On UPPMAX numba is part of python_ML_packages, so we use that. 

We are going to use the following program for testing (it was taken from 
https://linuxhint.com/gpu-programming-python/ but there are also many great examples at 
https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cuda/examples.html):

               return a + b;
 
             def main():
               a_source = np.ones(NUM_ELEMENTS, dtype=np.float32)
               b_source = np.ones(NUM_ELEMENTS, dtype=np.float32)
               
               # Time the CPU function
               start = timer()
               vector_add_cpu(a_source, b_source)
               vector_add_cpu_time = timer() - start

               start = timer()
               vector_add_gpu(a_source, b_source)
               vector_add_gpu_time = timer() - start
 
               # Report times
               print("CPU function took %f seconds." % vector_add_cpu_time)

             if __name__ == "__main__":
               main()
                 
As before, we need the batch system to run the code. There are no GPUs on the login nodes.

.. challenge:: Integration 2D with Numba

   An initial implementation of the 2D integration problem with the CUDA support for 
   Numba could be as follows:

   .. admonition:: ``integration2d_gpu.py``
      :class: dropdown

      .. code-block:: python

         from __future__ import division
         from numba import cuda, float32
         import numpy
         import math
         from time import perf_counter
         
         # grid size
         n = 100*1024
         threadsPerBlock = 16
         blocksPerGrid = int((n+threadsPerBlock-1)/threadsPerBlock)
         
         # interval size (same for X and Y)
         h = math.pi / float(n)
         
         @cuda.jit
         def dotprod(C):
             tid = cuda.threadIdx.x + cuda.blockIdx.x * cuda.blockDim.x 
         
             if tid >= n:
                 return
         
             #cummulative variable
             mysum = 0.0
             # fine-grain integration in the X axis
             x = h * (tid + 0.5)
             # regular integration in the Y axis
             for j in range(n):
                 y = h * (j + 0.5)
                 mysum += math.sin(x + y)
         
             C[tid] = mysum
         
         
         # array for collecting partial sums on the device
         C_global_mem = cuda.device_array((n),dtype=numpy.float32)
         
         starttime = perf_counter()
         dotprod[blocksPerGrid,threadsPerBlock](C_global_mem)
         res = C_global_mem.copy_to_host()
         integral = h**2 * sum(res)
         endtime = perf_counter()
         
         print("Integral value is %e, Error is %e" % (integral, abs(integral - 0.0)))
         print("Time spent: %.2f sec" % (endtime-starttime))



   Notice the larger size of the grid in the present case (100*1024) compared
   to the serial case's size we used previously (10000). Large computations are 
   necessary on the GPUs to get the benefits of this architecture. 

   One can take advantage of the shared memory in a thread block to write faster 
   code. Here, we wrote the 2D integration example from the previous section where 
   threads in a block write on a `shared[]` array. Then, this array is reduced 
   (values added) and the output is collected in the array ``C``. The entire code 
   is here:

             shared = cuda.shared.array(shape=(threadsPerBlock), dtype=float32)

             while s < cuda.blockDim.x:
                 if shrIndx % (2*s) == 0:
                     shared[shrIndx] += shared[shrIndx + s]
                 s *= 2
                 cuda.syncthreads()
             # collecting the reduced value in the C array
             if shrIndx == 0:
                 C[cuda.blockIdx.x] = shared[0]
         
         # array for collecting partial sums on the device
         C_global_mem = cuda.device_array((blocksPerGrid),dtype=numpy.float32)
         
         starttime = perf_counter()
         dotprod[blocksPerGrid,threadsPerBlock](C_global_mem)
         res = C_global_mem.copy_to_host()
         integral = h**2 * sum(res)
         endtime = perf_counter()
         
         print("Integral value is %e, Error is %e" % (integral, abs(integral - 0.0)))
         print("Time spent: %.2f sec" % (endtime-starttime))

   Prepare a batch script to run these two versions of the integration 2D with Numba support
   and monitor the timings for both cases.

Here follows a solution for HPC2N. Try and make it run on Snowy, using the python_ML_packages for Python 3.11.8 and the changes suggested by the UPPMAX solution for add-list.py above.

            python integration2d_gpu.py
            python integration2d_gpu_shared.py

     For the ``integration2d_gpu.py`` implementation, the time for executing the kernel 
     and doing some postprocessing to the outputs (copying the C array and doing a reduction) was 4.35 sec. which is a much smaller value than the time for the serial numba code of 152 sec obtained previously. 

     The simulation time for the ``integration2d_shared.py`` implementation was 1.87 sec. by using the shared memory trick. 

.. keypoints::

   -  You deploy GPU nodes via SLURM, either in interactive mode or batch
   -  In Python the numba package is handy
