Sessions: Interactive work on compute nodes
===========================================

.. questions::

   - How to reach the calculation nodes
   - How do I proceed to work interactively?
   
.. objectives:: 

   - be able to start interactive sessions
   - Be able to run Julia in Jupyter notebook

.. note::

   - It is possible to run Julia directly on the login (including ThinLinc) nodes.
   - But this should *only* be done for shorter jobs or jobs that do not use a lot of resources, as the login nodes can otherwise become slow for all users. 
   - If you want to work interactively with your code or data, you should start an interactive session.
   - If you rather will run a script which won't use any interactive user input while running, you can instead start a batch job, see next session.
   
There are several ways to run Julia interactively

- Directly on the login nodes: **only** do this for short jobs that do not take a lot of resources
- As an interactive job on the computer nodes, launched via the batch system
- Jupyter notebooks on compute node.

General
-------

In order to run interactively, you need to have compute nodes allocated to run on, and this is done through the Slurm system.  

Because you will have to wait until the nodes are allocated, and because you cannot know when this happens, this is not usually a recommended way to run Julia, but it is possible. 

.. warning::

   - (HPC2N) Do note that it is not *real* interactivity as you probably mean it, as you will have to run it as a Julia script instead of by starting Julia and giving commands inside it. 
   - The reason for this is that you are not actually logged into the compute node and only sees the output of the commands you run. 

Julia "interactively" on the compute nodes 
-------------------------------------------

.. note::

   - On UPPMAX and LUNARC: ``interactive ...``
      - You get graphics as well!
   - On HPC2N: ``salloc``
      - This command works as well on the other clusters but brings no or bad graphics.

   - When the resources are allocated, you need to preface commands with ``srun`` in order to run on the allocated nodes instead of the login node. 
      
- First, you make a request for resources with ``interactive``/``salloc``, like this:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX (interactive)

      .. code-block:: console
          
         $ interactive -n <tasks> --time=HHH:MM:SS -A naiss2024-22-1202
      
   .. tab:: HPC2N (salloc)

      .. code-block:: console
          
         $ salloc -n <tasks> --time=HHH:MM:SS -A hpc2n2023-114

   .. tab:: LUNARC (interactive)

      .. code-block:: console
          
         $ interactive -n <tasks> --time=HHH:MM:SS -A lu2024-7-80
      

      
where <tasks> is the number of tasks (or cores, for default 1 task per core), time is given in  hours, minutes, and seconds (maximum T168 hours), and then you give the id for your project 


- Your request enters the job queue just like any other job, and interactive/salloc will tell you that it is waiting for the requested resources. 
- When salloc tells you that your job has been allocated resources, you can interactively run programs on those resources with ``srun``. 
- The commands you run with ``srun`` will then be executed on the resources your job has been allocated. 

.. admonition:: On HPC2N

   - If you do not preface with ``srun`` the command is run on the login node! 
   - You can now run Julia scripts on the allocated resources directly instead of waiting for your batch job to return a result. 
   - This is an advantage if you want to test your Julia script or perhaps figure out which parameters are best.

   **Requesting 4 cores for 10 minutes, then running Julia**

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: UPPMAX

         .. code-block:: console
      
            [bjornc@rackham2 ~]$ interactive -A naiss2024-22-1202 -p core -n 4 -t 10:00
            You receive the high interactive priority.
            There are free cores, so your job is expected to start at once.
      
            Please, use no more than 6.4 GB of RAM.
      
            Waiting for job 29556505 to start...
            Starting job now -- you waited for 1 second.
          
            [bjornc@r483 ~]$ module load julia/1.8.5

         Let us check that we actually run on the compute node: 

         .. code-block:: console
      
            [bjornc@r483 ~]$ srun hostname
            r483.uppmax.uu.se
            r483.uppmax.uu.se
            r483.uppmax.uu.se
            r483.uppmax.uu.se

         We are. Notice that we got a response from all four cores we have allocated.   

      .. tab:: HPC2N
         
         .. code-block:: console
      
            [~]$ salloc -n 4 --time=00:30:00 -A hpc2n2024-114
            salloc: Pending job allocation 20174806

         Let us check that we actually run on the compute node: 
      
         .. code-block:: console
                  
            [~]$ srun hostname
            b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
            b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
            b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
            b-cn0241.hpc2n.umu.se
      
         We are. Notice that we got a response from all four cores we have allocated.   

      .. tab:: LUNARC
   
         .. code-block:: console
      
            [bjornc@cosmos1 ~]$ interactive -A lu2024-7-80 -n 4 -t 10:00
            Cluster name: COSMOS   
            Waiting for JOBID 930844 to start
          
            [bjornc@cn050 ~]$ module load Julia/1.8.5-linux-x86_64

         Let us check that we actually run on the compute node: 

         .. code-block:: console
      
            [bjornc@cn050 ~]$ echo $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE
            4

         We are, because the $SLURM* environment variable gves an output. Notice that we got 4, whihc is nt the size of the physcial node bt the allocation size.   

      
Running a script
''''''''''''''''

**The script** 
      Adding two numbers from user input (serial-sum.jl)
         
      .. code-block:: julia
      
          # This program will add two numbers that are provided by the user
          
          # Get the numbers
          x = parse( Int32, ARGS[1] )
          y = parse( Int32, ARGS[2] )
          # Add the two numbers together
          summ = x + y
          println("The sum of the two numbers is ", summ)
          
      
**Running the script**

- Note that the commands are the same for both HPC2N and UPPMAX!
      
      Running a Julia script in the allocation we made further up. Notice that since we asked for 4 cores, the script is run 4 times, since it is a serial script
         
      .. code-block:: console
      
          [~]$ srun julia serial-sum.jl 3 4
          The sum of the two numbers is: 7
          The sum of the two numbers is: 7
          The sum of the two numbers is: 7
          The sum of the two numbers is: 7
          [~]$             
                        
      Without the ``srun`` command, Julia won't understand that it can use several cores. Therefore the program is run only once.
                  
      .. code-block:: sh 
                  
                  [~]$ julia serial-sum.jl 3 4 
                  The sum of the two numbers is: 7

**Running Julia REPL (UPPMAX/HPC2N)**

- First start Julia using the 4 cores and check if workers are available

.. code-block:: console 
 
   $ julia -p 4
         
.. code-block:: julia-repl

   julia> nworkers()
   4


**Exit**

When you have finished using the allocation, either wait for it to end, or close it with ``exit``

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX
   
      .. code-block:: console 
                  
                  [bjornc@r483 ~]$ exit
      
                  exit
                  [screen is terminating]
                  Connection to r483 closed.
      
                  [bjornc@rackham2 ~]$
     
   .. tab:: HPC2N
   
      .. code-block:: sh 
                  
                  [~]$ exit
                  exit
                  salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 20174806
                  salloc: Job allocation 20174806 has been revoked.
                  [~]$

   .. tab:: LUNARC
   
      .. code-block:: sh 
                  
                  [~]$ exit
                  exit
                  [screen is terminating]
                  Connection to cn050 closed.

Running IJulia and Jupyter notebooks
------------------------------------


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX

      - For more interactiveness you can run IJulia.
      - You benefit a lot if you are using ThinLinc
      - Like for Python it is possible to run a Julia in a notebook, i.e. in a web interface with possibility of inline figures and debugging. An easy way to do this is to load the python module as well. In shell:

         .. code-block:: console

            $ module load julia/1.8.5
            $ module load python/3.10.8
            $ julia

      In Julia:

         .. code-block:: julia-repl

            julia> using IJulia
            julia> notebook(dir="</path/to/work/dir/>")

      A Firefox session should start with the Jupyter notebook interface.

      .. figure:: ../../img/Jupyter_julia.png

      .. warning:: 

         **If not**, you may have to build IJulia the first time with Pkg.build("IJulia"). Since "IJulia" is *pre-installed centrally* on UPPMAX you must activate the central environment by following these steps below. This should only be needed the first time like this

      .. code-block:: julia-repl
            
         julia> using Pkg
         julia> Pkg.activate(DEPOT_PATH[2]*"/environments/v1.8");
         julia> Pkg.build("IJulia")
         julia> notebook(dir="</path/to/work/dir/>")

      This builds the package also locally before starting the notebook. If not done, Jupyter will not find the Julia kernel of that version.

      .. tip::

         With ``notebook(dir="</path/to/work/dir/>", detached=true)`` the notebook will not be killed when you exit your REPL Julia session in the terminal.

      .. admonition:: Running IJulia in Jupyter on compute nodes

         - Jupyter is rather slow on the compute nodes. 
         - This can be fixed by opening jupyter in a web browsers on your local computer or in ThinLinc
         - Remember to load python as well and to go via the ``julia -p <number of cores>`` and ``notebook(<options>)`` inside the Julia session instead of starting ``jupiter-notebook`` in the bash shell.
         - https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/jupyter.html

      **Jupyter from terminal**
      
      If IJulia is precompiled once then you can run Julia from Jupyter directly from the terminal

         .. code-block: console

            $ ml julia/1.8.5 python/3.10.8
            $ jupyter-notebook --no-browser

      - Start the browser from the ThinLinc menu.
      - Copy-paste one of the address lines from the jupyter output
      - You can start the Julia kernel in the upper right corner!

   .. tab:: HPC2N & LUNARC

      - Like for Python it is possible to run a Julia in a Jupyter, i.e. in a web interface with possibility of inline figures and debugging. An easy way to do this is to load the *JupyterLab* and *Julia* modules. In shell:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ module load GCCcore/13.2.0  JupyterLab/4.2.0 
         $ module load Julia/1.8.5-linux-x86_64
         $ julia

      In Julia `package` mode:

      .. code-block:: julia-repl

         (v1.8) pkg>add IJulia
         (v1.8) pkg>build IJulia         

      Write a bash script similar  to this (call it `job_jupyter.sh`, for instance):

      .. code-block:: bash

         #!/bin/bash
         # Here you should put your own project id
         #SBATCH -A hpc2n2024-114
         # This example asks for 1 core
         #SBATCH -n 1
         # Ask for a suitable amount of time. Remember, this is the time the Jupyter notebook will be available! HHH:MM:SS.
         #SBATCH --time=00:10:00
         # Clear the environment from any previously loaded modules
         module purge > /dev/null 2>&1
         # Load the module environment suitable for the job
         module load GCCcore/13.2.0  JupyterLab/4.2.0 
         # Load the Julia module
         ml Julia/1.8.5-linux-x86_64
         # Start JupyterLab
         jupyter lab --no-browser --ip $(hostname)

      Then, in the output file *slurm-<jobID>.out* file, copy the url that starts with *http://b-cn1403.hpc2n.umu.se:8888/lab* and 
      paste it in a Firefox browser on Kebnekaise. When the Jupyter notebook interface starts, you can choose the Julia
      version from the module you loaded (in this case 1.8.5).

      .. admonition:: Running Julia in Jupyter on compute nodes at HPC2N

         - On Kebnekaise, you can run Jupyter notebooks with Julia kernels by using batch scripts    
         - https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/tutorials/jupyter/#jupyterlab__with__julia

Exercises
---------

.. challenge:: 1. Try to run scripts from an interactive session 

   - Try out one or two of the scripts from the exercise folder ``batchJulia``.
   - First create an interactive session with the right Slurm commands to the ``interactive``/``salloc`` command.
       - use the commands from the batch job script belonging to the julia script at `examples of batch scripts for julia <https://uppmax.github.io/R-python-julia-matlab-HPC/julia/batchJulia.html#examples-of-batch-scripts-for-julia>`_


.. keypoints::

   - Start an interactive session on a calculation node by a SLURM allocation
   
      - At HPC2N: ``salloc`` ...
      - At UPPMAX/LUNARC: ``interactive`` ...
   - Follow the same procedure as usual by loading the Julia module and possible prerequisites.
   - Run Julia in Jupyter lab/notebook

      - Procedure is to use the IJulia package and start a jupyter notebook from the julia command line.
