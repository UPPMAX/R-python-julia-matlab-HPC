Use the tarball
===============

.. admonition:: Goal

    You can run the example files needed for the exercises 

A tarball is a file that contains multiple files,
similar to a zip file.
To use the files it contains, it needs to be untarred/unzipped/uncompressed
first.

Procedure
---------

The procedure has these steps:

- Get the tarbal
- Uncompress the tarbal

Step 1: get the tarbal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a terminal, use the following command to download the file
to your current folder:

.. code-block::  console

    wget https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-matlab-HPC/raw/refs/heads/main/exercises/exercises.tar.gz

.. admonition:: How does that look like?
   :class: dropdown

    .. code-block::  console
    

        [richel@rackham3 ~]$ wget https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-matlab-HPC/raw/refs/heads/main/exercises/exercises.tar.gz
        --2024-10-23 11:49:30--  https://github.com/UPPMAX/R-python-julia-matlab-HPC/raw/refs/heads/main/exercises/exercises.tar.gz

Step 2: Uncompress the tarbal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a terminal, use the following command to uncompress the file:

.. code-block::  console

    tar -xvzf exercises.tar.gz 

.. admonition:: How does that look like?
   :class: dropdown

    .. code-block::  console

        [richel@rackham3 ~]$ tar -xvzf exercises.tar.gz

After decompressing, there is a folder called ``exercises``
that contains the exercises.
