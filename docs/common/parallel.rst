.. questions::

   - What is parallel programming?

   - When can I use it?

.. objectives:: 

   - Learn basic concepts in parallel programming
   - Gain knowledge on the tools for parallel programming in different languages
   - Familiarize with the tools to monitor the usage of resources 


What is parallel programming?
-----------------------------

Parallel programming is the science and art of writing code that execute tasks on different
computing units (cores) simultaneously. In the past computers were shiped with a
single core per Central Processing Unit (CPU) and therefore only
a single computation at the time (serial program) could be executed.

Nowadays computer architectures are more complex than the single core CPU mentioned
already. For instance, common architectures include those where several cores in a
CPU share a common memory space and also those where CPUs are connected through some
network interconnect.

   :width: 550
   :align: center

   Shared Memory and Distributed Memory architectures.
 
A more realistic picture of a computer architecture can be seen in the following 
picture where we have 14 cores that shared a common memory of 64 GB. These cores
form the socket and the two sockets shown in this picture constitute a node.

.. figure:: ../../img/cpus.png
   :width: 550
   :align: center

It is interesting to notice that there are different types of memory
available for the cores, ranging from the L1 cache to the node's memory for a single
node. In the former, the bandwidth can be TB/s while in the latter GB/s.

Now you can see that on a single node you already have several computing units
(cores) and also a hierarchy of memory resources which is denoted as Non Uniform
Memory Access (NUMA).

Besides the standard CPUs, nowadays one finds Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) 
architectures in HPC clusters.



Why is parallel programming needed?
-----------------------------------

There is no "free lunch" when trying to use features (computing/memory resources) in
modern architectures. If you want your code to be aware of those features, you will
need to either add them explicitly (by coding them yourself) or implicitly (by using
libraries that were coded by others).

In your local machine, you may have some number of cores available and some memory 
attached to them which can be exploited by using a parallel program. There can be
some limited resources for running your data-production simulations as you may use
your local machine for other purposes such as writing a manuscript, making a presentation,
etc. One alternative to your local machine can be a High Performance Computing (HPC)
cluster another could be a cloud service. A common layout for the resources in an
HPC cluster is a shown in the figure below.

.. figure:: ../../img/workflow-hpc.png
   :width: 550
   :align: center

   High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

Although a serial application can run in such a cluster, it would not gain much of the
HPC resources. If fact, one can underuse the cluster if one allocates more resources than
what the simulation requires.

.. warning::
   
   - Check if the resources that you allocated are being used properly.  
   - Monitor the usage of hardware resources with tools offered at your HPC center, for instance
     `job-usage at HPC2N <https://hpc2n.github.io/intro-course/software/#best__practices>`_.   
   - Here there are some examples (of many) of what you will need to pay attention when porting 
     a parallel code from your laptop (or another HPC center) to our clusters:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: HPC2N

         We have a tool to monitor the usage of resources called: 
         `job-usage at HPC2N <https://hpc2n.github.io/intro-course/software/#best__practices>`_.

      .. tab:: UPPMAX 

         If you are in a interactive node session the ``top`` command will give you information
         of the resources usage. 


Common parallel programming paradigms
-------------------------------------

Now the question is how to take advantage of modern architectures which consist of many-cores,
interconnected through networks, and that have different types of memory available?
Python, Julia, Matlab, and R languages have different tools and libraries that can help you
to get more from your local machine or HPC cluster resources.

Threaded programming
''''''''''''''''''''

To take advantage of the shared memory of the cores, **threaded** mechanisms can be used.
Low-level programming languages, such as Fortran/C/C++, use OpenMP as the standard
application programming interface (API) to parallelize programs by using a threaded mechanism.
Here, all threads have access to the same data and can do computations simultaneously. 
From this  we infer that without doing any modification to our code
we can get the benefits from parallel computing by turning-on/off external libraries,
by setting environment variables such as ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``.

Higher-level languages have their own mechanisms to generate threads and this can be
confusing especially if the code is using external libraries, linear algebra for instance
(LAPACK, BLAS, ...). These libraries have their own threads (OpenMP for example) and
the code you are writing (R, Julia, Python, or Matlab) can also have some internal threded mechanism.

.. warning::
   
   - Check if the libraries/packages that you are using have a threaded mechanism. 
   - Monitor the usage of hardware resources with tools offered at your HPC center, for instance
     `job-usage at HPC2N <https://hpc2n.github.io/intro-course/software/#best__practices>`_.   
   - Here there are some examples (of many) of what you will need to pay attention when porting 
     a parallel code from your laptop (or another HPC center) to our clusters:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Python

         For some linear algebra operations Numpy supports threads (set with the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` variable). 
         If your code contains calls to these operations in a loop that is already parallelized by *n* processes, 
         and you allocate *n* cores for this job, this job will exceed the allocated resources unless the 
         number of threads is explicitly set to 1.

      .. tab:: Julia 

         For some linear algebra operations Julia supports threads (set with the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` variable). 
         If your code contains calls to these operations in a loop that is already parallelized by *n* processes, 
         and you allocate *n* cores for this job, this job will exceed the allocated resources unless the 
         number of threads is explicitly set to 1. Notice that Julia also has its own threaded mechanism.

      .. tab:: R  

         Creating a cluster with *n* cores (makeCluster) and start traing a ML model with flags such as 
         ``allowParallel`` set to ``TRUE`` or ``num.threads`` set to a value such as the total number of requested
         cores is exceeded.

      .. tab:: Matlab 

         Using a **CPLEX** solver inside a *parfor* loop. These solvers work in a *oportunistic* manner meaning that
         they will try to use all the resources available in the machine. If you request *n* cores for *parfor* in 
         your batch job, these cores will be used by the solver. Theoretically, you will be using *nxn* cores although 
         only *n* were requested. One way to solve this issue is by setting the number of threads 
         ``cplex.Param.threads.Cur`` to 1. 

A common issue with shared memory programming is *data racing* which happens when 
different threads write on the same memory address.

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Python

         Python offers its own threaded mechanism but due to a locking mechanism, `Python threads` 
         are not efficient for computation. However, Python threads could be useful for I/O files handling. 
         Code modifications are required to support the threads.

      .. tab:: Julia 

         The mechanism here is called `Julia threads` which is performant and can be activated by 
         executing a script as follows ``julia --threads X script.jl``, where *X* is the number of
         threads. Code modifications are required to support the threads.

      .. tab:: R 

         R doesn't have a threaded mechanism as the other languages discussed in this course. Some 
         functions provided by certain packages (parallel, doParallel, etc.), for instance, *foreach*, 
         offer parallel features but memory is not shared across the workers. This could lead to 
         `data replication <https://hpc2n.github.io/intro-course/software/#recommendations>`_.

      .. tab:: Matlab 

         Starting from version 2020a, Matlab offers the `ThreadPool <https://se.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/parallel.threadpool.html>`_ 
         functionality that can leverage the power of threads sharing a common memory. This could 
         potentially lead to a faster code compared to other schemes (Distributed discussed below)
         but notice that the code is not expected to support multi-node simulations. 


Distributed programming
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Although threaded programming is convenient because one can achieve considerable initial speedups
with little code modifications, this approach does not scale for more than hundreds of 
cores. Scalability can be achieved with distributed programming. Here, there is not
a common shared memory but the individual `processes` (notice the different terminology
with `threads` in shared memory) have their own memory space. Then, if a process requires
data from or should transfer data to another process, it can do that by using `send` and
`receive` to transfer messages. A standard API for distributed computing is the Message 
Passing Interface (MPI). In general, MPI requires refactoring of your code.

.. admonition:: Language-specific nuances for distributed programming
   :class: dropdown

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Python

         Python has different modules for achieving distributed programming, for instance ``multiprocessing`` and 
         ``mpi4py``. The former is part of the Python standard library so you don't need to do further installations,
         while the latter needs to be installed. Also, one needs to learn the concepts of MPI prior to using the
         feautures offered by this module.

      .. tab:: Julia 

         The mechanism here is called `Julia processes` which  can be activated by executing a script as follows 
         ``julia -p X script.jl``, where *X* is the number of processes. Code modifications are required to support the 
         workers. Julia also supports MPI through the package ``MPI.jl``.

      .. tab:: R 

         R doesn't have a multiprocessing mechanism as the other languages discussed in this course. Some 
         functions provided by certain packages (parallel, doParallel, etc.), for instance, *foreach*, 
         offer parallel features. The processes generated by these functions have their own workspace which 
         could lead to `data replication <https://hpc2n.github.io/intro-course/software/#recommendations>`_.
         MPI is supported in R through the ``Rmpi`` package.

      .. tab:: Matlab 

         In Matlab one can use the ``parpool('my-cluster',X)`` where *X* is the number of workers. See the 
         `documentation for parpool <https://se.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/parpool.html>`_ from MatWorks.
         Matlab doesn't support MPI function calls in Matlab code, it could be used indirectly through 
         `mex <https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html>`_ functions though. 

Big data
''''''''

Sometimes the workflow you are targeting doesn't require extensive computations but mainly dealing with
big pieces of data. An example can be, reading a column-structured file and doing some transformation per-column.
Fortunately, all languages covered in this course have already several tools to deal with big data.
We list some of these tools in what follows but notice that other tools doing similar jobs can be 
available for each language. 

.. admonition:: Language-specific tools for big data

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Python

         **Dask**
 
         `Dask <https://www.dask.org/>`_ is a array model extension and task scheduler. By using the new array 
         classes, you can automatically distribute operations across multiple CPUs.

         Dask is very popular for data analysis and is used by a number of high-level Python libraries:

            - Dask arrays scale NumPy (see also xarray)
            - Dask dataframes scale Pandas workflows
            - Dask-ML scales Scikit-Learn

         - Dask divides arrays into many small pieces (chunks), as small as necessary to fit it into memory. 
         - Operations are delayed (lazy computing) e.g. tasks are queue and no computation is performed until 
           you actually ask values to be computed (for instance print mean values). 
         - Then data is loaded into memory and computation proceeds in a streaming fashion, block-by-block.
         - An example of a Jupyter notebook running Dask can be found 
           `here <https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/Exercises/examples/Dask-Ini.ipynb>`_. 

      .. tab:: Julia

         **Dagger** 

         According to the developers of this framework, `Dagger <https://juliaparallel.org/Dagger.jl/dev/>`_ 
         is heavily inspired on Dask. It support distributed arrays so that they could fit the memory and
         also the possibility of parallelizing the computations on these arrays. 

      .. tab:: R 
   
         `Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/index.html>`_ (previously *disk.frame*) can deal with 
         big arrays. Other tools include `data.table <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html>`_
         and `bigmemory <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/index.html>`_. 

      .. tab:: Matlab 
   
         In Matlab `Tall Arrays <https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/tall-arrays.html>`_ and
         `Distributed Arrays <https://se.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/distributed-arrays.html>`_
         will assist you when dealing with large arrays.


-------------------

.. demo:: 
   :class: dropdown

   The idea is to parallelize a simple *for loop* (language-agnostic): 

   .. code-block:: sh 

      for i start at 1 end at 4 
         wait 1 second 
      end the for loop

   The waiting step is used to simulate a task without writing too much code. In this way,
   one can realize how faster the loop can be executed when threads are added:

      .. tab:: Python

         In the following example ``sleep.py`` the `sleep()` function is called `n` times first in 
         serial mode and then by using `n` processes. To parallelize the serial code we can use 
         the ``multiprocessing`` module that is shipped with the base library in Python so that 
         you don't need to install it.  

         .. code-block:: python

            import sys
            from time import perf_counter,sleep
            import multiprocessing

            # number of iterations 
            n = 4
            # number of processes
            numprocesses = 4

            def sleep_serial(n):
                for i in range(n):
                    sleep(1)


            def sleep_threaded(n,numprocesses,processindex):
                # workload for each process
                workload = n/numprocesses
                begin = int(workload*processindex)
                end = int(workload*(processindex+1))
                for i in range(begin,end):
                    sleep(1)

            if __name__ == "__main__":

                starttime = perf_counter()   # Start timing serial code
                sleep_serial(n)
                endtime = perf_counter()

                print("Time spent serial: %.2f sec" % (endtime-starttime))


                starttime = perf_counter()   # Start timing parallel code
                processes = []
                for i in range(numprocesses):
                    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=sleep_threaded, args=(n,numprocesses,i))
                    processes.append(p)
                    p.start()

                # waiting for the processes
                for p in processes:
                    p.join()

                endtime = perf_counter()

                print("Time spent parallel: %.2f sec" % (endtime-starttime))

         First load the modules ``ml GCCcore/10.3.0 Python/3.9.5`` and then run the script
         with the command  ``python sleep.py`` to use 4 processes.

      .. tab:: Julia

         In the following example ``sleep-threads.jl`` the `sleep()` function is called `n` times
         first in serial mode and then by using `n` threads. The *BenchmarkTools* package
         help us to time the code (as this package is not in the base Julia installation you will need
         to install it).

         .. code-block:: julia

            using BenchmarkTools
            using .Threads
            
            n = 4   # number of iterations
             
            function sleep_serial(n)   #Serial version
                for i in 1:n
                    sleep(1)
                end
            end
            
            @btime sleep_serial(n) evals=1 samples=1
            
            function sleep_threaded(n) #Parallel version
                @threads for i = 1:n
                    sleep(1)
                end
            end
            
            @btime sleep_threaded(n) evals=1 samples=1
            
         First load the Julia module ``ml Julia/1.8.5-linux-x86_64`` and then run the script
         with the command  ``julia --threads 6 sleep-threads.jl`` to use 4 Julia threads.

         We can also use the *Distributed* package that allows the scaling of simulations beyond
         a single node (call the script ``sleep-distributed.jl``): 

         .. code-block:: julia

            using BenchmarkTools
            using Distributed 

            n = 4   # number of iterations

            function sleep_parallel(n)
                @distributed for i in 1:n
                    sleep(1)
                end
            end         

         Run the script with the command  ``julia -p 4 sleep-distributed.jl`` to use 4 Julia processes.

      .. tab:: R 
   
         In the following example ``sleep.R`` the `Sys.sleep()` function is called `n` times
         first in serial mode and then by using `n` processes. Start by loading the 
         modules ``ml GCC/10.2.0 OpenMPI/4.0.5 R/4.0.4``

         .. code-block:: r
        
            library(doParallel)

            # number of iterations = number of processes
            n <- 4

            sleep_serial <- function(n) {
              for (i in 1:n) {
                  Sys.sleep(1)
              }
            }

            serial_time <- system.time(   sleep_serial(n)   )[3]
            serial_time

            sleep_parallel <- function(n) {
              r <- foreach(i=1:n) %dopar% Sys.sleep(1)
            }
              
            cl <- makeCluster(n)
            registerDoParallel(cl)
            parallel_time <- system.time(    sleep_parallel(n)   )[3]
            stopCluster(cl)
            parallel_time

         Run the script with the command  ``Rscript --no-save --no-restore sleep.R``.

      .. tab:: Matlab 
   
         In Matlab one can use the function `pause()` to wait for some number of secods.
         The Matlab module we tested can be loaded as ``ml MATLAB/2023a.Update4``.  

         .. code-block:: matlab
        
            % Get a handler for the cluster
            c=parcluster('kebnekaise');

            n = 4;  % Number of iterations

            % Run the job with 1 worker and submit the job to the batch queue
            j = c.batch(@sleep_serial, 1, {4}, 'pool', 1);
            % Wait till the job has finished
            j.wait;
            % Fetch the result after the job has finished
            t = j.fetchOutputs{:};
            fprintf('Time taken for serial version: %.2f seconds\n', t);

            % Run the job with 4 worker and submit the job to the batch queue
            j = c.batch(@sleep_parallel, 1, {4}, 'pool', 4);
            % Wait till the job has finished
            j.wait;
            % Fetch the result after the job has finished
            t = j.fetchOutputs{:};
            fprintf('Time taken for parallel version: %.2f seconds\n', t);

            % Serial version
            function t_serial = sleep_serial(n)
            % Start timming
            tic;
               for i = 1:n
                  pause(1);
               end
            t_serial = toc;  % stop timing
            end

            % Parallel version
            function t_parallel = sleep_parallel(n)
            % Start timing
            tic;
               parfor i = 1:n
                  pause(1);
               end
            t_parallel = toc; % stop timing
            end

         You can run this code directly in the Matlab GUI.

.. challenge:: Running a parallel code efficiently

   In this exercise we will run a parallelized code that performs a 2D integration:

      .. math:: 
          \int^{\pi}_{0}\int^{\pi}_{0}\sin(x+y)dxdy = 0

   One way to perform the integration is by creating a grid in the ``x`` and ``y`` directions.
   More specifically, one divides the integration range in both directions into ``n`` bins.

.. challenge:: Parallelizing a *for loop* workflow (Advanced)
   :class: dropdown

   Create a Data Frame containing two features, one called **ID** which has integer values 
   from 1 to 10000, and the other called **Value** that contains 10000 integers starting from 3
   and goes in steps of 2 (3, 5, 7, ...). The following codes contain parallelized workflows
   whose goal is to compute the average of the whole feature **Value** using some number of 
   workers. Substitute the **FIXME** strings in the following codes to perform the tasks given
   in the comments. 

   *The main idea for all languages is to divide the workload across all workers*.
   You can run the codes as suggested for each language.
