Add-Ons
=======

.. admonition:: MATLAB Add-Ons
   
   - Add-ons extend the capabilities of MATLAB® by providing additional functionality for specific tasks and applications, such as:
      - connecting to hardware devices
      - additional algorithms
      - interactive apps
   - Available from:
      - MathWorks® 
      - the global MATLAB user community
   - Encompass a wide variety of resources
      - products
      - apps
      - toolboxes
      - support packages
   - `More information <https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/add-ons.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnavZ>`_
   

.. admonition:: Learners should be able to

   - navigate to toolboxes and Add-Ons
   - view Add-Ons and toolboxes
   - install and use Add-Ons    
   
- Before going into installing Add-Ons let's have a background to the MATLAB environments and ecosystem!

MATLAB Add-Ons manager
----------------------

.. figure:: ./img/Toolbar_Add-Ons.PNG


In the GUI, the Add-Ons manager can be selected from the menu at the top. The drop-down menu options allow users to:

   - **Browse a library of Add-Ons to download.** Note that some Add-Ons require a separate license.

     .. figure:: ./img/Add-On_explorer.PNG


   - **Manage Add-Ons already downloaded.**

   .. figure:: ./img/Add-On_manager.PNG


   - Package user-generated code as a Toolbox or App

   - Get hardware-related support packages

Here we will only focus on the first two options.

.. note::

   Note that very many packages are already included in the  Academic installation and license

.. figure:: ./img/my_products.PNG

.. admonition:: Some toolboxes

   - Matlab products
      - Parallel Computing Toolbox
      - MATLAB Parallel Server
      - Deep Learning Toolbox
      - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
   - Simulink
      - Stateflow
      - SimEvents
      - Simscape

.. admonition:: Some toolboxes provides GUI for their tools Apps

   - Matlab products
      - Deep Network Designer - Design and visualize deep learning networks Deep Network Designer
      - Curve Fitter - Fit curves and surfaces to data
      - Deep Learning Toolbox
      - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
   - Simulink
      - Stateflow
      - SimEvents
      - Simscape

    .. figure:: ./img/apps.PNG

    - We won't cover the usage of the toolboxes here!

Install Add-Ons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Search in add-ons explorer and install.

.. figure:: ./img/searchforaddons.PNG

- Ends up in local folder and is in the part so it should be reached wherever you are in the file tree.

- ``~/MATLAB Add-Ons``

- It's in the path so it should be possible to run directly if you don't need to run a installation file.

- For more information about a specific support package install location, see the documentation for the package.

.. warning::

   To be able to install you need to use the email for a **personal mathworks account**.

.. seealso::

   You can install some Add-Ons manually using an installation file. This is useful in several situations:

   - The add-on is not available for installation through the Add-On Explorer, for example, if you create a custom add-on yourself or receive one from someone else.
   - You downloaded the add-on from the Add-On Explorer without installing it.
   - You downloaded the add-on from the File Exchange at MATLAB Central™.
   - `MathWorkds page on getting Add-Ons <https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html>`_ 

.. demo:: 

   - Search for ``kalmanf``
   - Click "Learning the Kalman Filter"
   - Look at the documentation
   - Test if the command works today:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      >> kalmanf
      Unrecognized function or variable 'kalmanf'.

   - OK, it is not there
   - Click "Add", and "Download and Add to path"
   - Type email address connected to your MathWorks account
   - Installation starts
   - It will end up in: 

   .. code-block:: console

      $ tree MATLAB\ Add-Ons/
      MATLAB\ Add-Ons/
      └── Collections
      |   └── Efficient\ GRIB1\ data\ reader

   - Evidently it is a ``function``. Note that I already have something classified as ``collections``
   - Now test:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      >> kalmanf()
      'kalmanf' requires Learning the Kalman Filter version 1.0.0.0 to be enabled.
   
   - OK. It is installed but may need some other things. Just an example!!

Exercises
---------

.. challenge:: 1. Find the **kalmanf** and install it and run a test command.

.. challenge:: 2. (Optional) Browse the add-ons and get inspired for your own work!

.. keypoints:: 

   - Many Add-Ons, like toolboxes and packages are available at the Clusters
   - You can view add-ons and toolboxes

      - It is all more or less graphical

    - You can install add-ons

      - Search in add-ons explorer and install.
      - Ends up in local folder and is in the path so it should be reached wherever you are in the file tree.
