Session-UPPMAX: Matlab client on the desktop
=====================================

.. admonition:: Use own computer's matlab

   - Would you like to try run batch jobs on the Rackham or Snowy cluster but use the faster graphics that you can achieve on your own computer?
   - UPPMAX offers this now.

.. warning::

   - This solution is possible only if
      - you have an UPPMAX compute project and 
      - a working matlab on your computer with one of the version available on the cluster:
         - check with ``module avail matlab``
         - Examples of the newest ones: 
            - R2020b
            - R2022a
            - R2022b
            - R2023a
            - R2023b


Let's get started together!
---------------------------

.. demo::

   - You can try to type-along

The Rackham MATLAB support package can be found at `uppsala.Desktop.zip <https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/raw/main/docs/software/files/matlab/uppsala.Desktop.zip>`_.


- Download the ZIP file and start MATLAB.
- The ZIP file should be unzipped in the location returned by calling

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> userpath

- You can unzip from MATLAB's Command window.

- Configure MATLAB to run parallel jobs on the cluster by calling ``configCluster``. ``configCluster`` only needs to be called once per version of MATLAB.

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> configCluster
   Username on RACKHAM (e.g. jdoe):  

- Type your rackham user name.
- As a result:

.. code-block:: matlab 
   
   Complete.  Default cluster profile set to "Rackham R2022b".


.. note:: 

   - To submit jobs to the local machine instead of the cluster, run the following:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      >> % Get a handle to the local resources
      >> c = parcluster('local');


CONFIGURING JOBS
................

Prior to submitting the job, various parameters can be assigned, such as queue, e-mail, walltime, etc.  The following is a partial list of parameters.  See AdditionalProperties for the complete list.  Only AccountName, Partition, MemUsage and WallTime.

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> % Get a handle to the cluster
   >> c = parcluster;

   c = 

    Generic Cluster

       Properties: 

                      Profile: Rackham R2022b
                     Modified: false
                         Host: UUC-4GM8L33.user.uu.se
                   NumWorkers: 100000
                   NumThreads: 1

        JobStorageLocation: <path to job outputs locally>
         ClusterMatlabRoot: /sw/apps/matlab/x86_64/R2022b
           OperatingSystem: unix

Set some additional parameters related to Slurm on Rackham

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> % Specify the account
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.AccountName = 'naiss2024-22-1202';

   >> % Specify the wall time (e.g., 1 day, 5 hours, 30 minutes
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.WallTime = '00:30:00';

   >> % Specify cores per node
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.ProcsPerNode = 20;


   [OPTIONAL]

   >> % Specify the partition
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'devcore';

   >> % Specify another cluster: 'snowy'
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.ClusterName='snowy'
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.ProcsPerNode = 16;

   >> % Specify number of GPUs
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.GPUsPerNode = 1;
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.GPUCard = 'gpu-card';

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> c.saveProfile

To see the values of the current configuration options, display AdditionalProperties.

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> % To view current properties
   >> c.AdditionalProperties

Unset a value when no longer needed.

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> % Example Turn off email notifications
   >> c.AdditionalProperties.EmailAddress = '';
   >> c.saveProfile


Start job
.........

- Copy this script and paste in a new file ``parallel_example_local.m`` that you save in the working directory where you are (check with ``pwd`` in the Matlab Command Window).
    - The script is supposed to loop over ``sleepTime`` seconds of work ``nLoopIters`` times. 
    - We will define the number of processes in the batch submit line.

.. code-block:: matlab

   function t = parallel_example_local(nLoopIters, sleepTime)
   t0 = tic;
   parfor idx = 1:nLoopIters
      A(idx) = idx;
      pause(sleepTime);
   end
   t = toc(t0);


.. code-block:: matlab

   job = c.batch(@parallel_example_local, 1, {16,1}, 'Pool',8,'CurrentFolder','.');

- Submission to the cluster requires SSH credentials. 
- You will be prompted for username and password or identity file (private key). 
    - It will not ask again until you define a new cluster handle ``c`` or in next session.

.. figure:: ./img/matlab_usercred.PNG

.. figure:: ./img/matlab_enterpasswd.PNG

- Jobs will now default to the cluster rather than submit to the local machine.

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> job.State

   ans =

       'running'

- You can run this several times until it gives 

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> job.State

   ans =

       'finished'

- You can also watch queue

.. figure:: ./img/matlab_jobmonitor.PNG

- Or on Rackham (it really runs there!):

.. code-block:: console

   [bjornc2@rackham2 ~]$ squeue -u bjornc2
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          50827312   devcore MATLAB_R  bjornc2  R       2:20      1 r483

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> job.fetchOutputs{:}

   ans =

       2.4853

- The script looped over 1 s work 16 times, but with 8 processes.
- In an ideal world it would have taken ``16 / 8 = 2 s``. Now it took 2.5 s with some "overhead"

.. admonition:: Run on Snowy

   .. code-block:: matlab

      >> c.AdditionalProperties.ClusterName='snowy'
      >> c.AdditionalProperties.ProcsPerNode = 16;



Exercises
---------

.. challenge:: 1. Configure your local Matlab to talk to UPPMAX

   - Use the instructions above to try to make it work!

.. challenge:: 2. Run a script on snowy

   - Try to run a script from the `MATLAB GUI and SLURM session <./jobsMatlab.html>`_
   - Check in a rackham terminal: ``squeue -M snowy --me``
