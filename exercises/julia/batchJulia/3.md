# 3. Machine Learning job on GPUs (on HPC2N)

    Julia has already several packages for ML, one of them is ``Flux`` (https://fluxml.ai/). We will work with one of
    the test cases provided by ``Flux`` which deals with a data set of tiny images (CIFAR10). Follow this steps:

        - Create an environment called ``ML``, move to that environment directory and activate it 
        - Fetch the ``vgg_cifar10.jl`` test case from ``Flux`` repo (wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FluxML/model-zoo/master/vision/vgg_cifar10/vgg_cifar10.jl)
        - Load CUDA toolkit 11.4.1
        - Install (add) the following packages: CUDA, MLDatasets, MLUtils
        - The first time you use the data set CIFAR10, it will ask you to download it and accept. Do this in ``Julian`` mode:

            julia> using MLDatasets: CIFAR10
            julia> x, y = CIFAR10(:train)[:]

        - Change the number of epochs in the ``vgg_cifar10.jl`` script from 50 to something shorter like 5.
        - Submit the job with the script.
