# Julia evaluation 2023-10-18

 * Number of learners: 2

Feedback:

 * Today was faster than yesterday. 
 * For example, teach fewer things more in-depth
 * Remove the standard things, such as package management, etc, as
   it feels like a waste of time.
   Instead focus more on how to leverage the power of Julia on HPC,
   by, e.g. showing an analysis using machine learning or AI,
   in combination to make graphs.
 * Have a red thread/'learning line' in the course and follow that one.
   Pick a clear course goal
