## Progress

Use Python 3.11.8 on UPPMAX

 * [Done] Packages
 * [Done] Virtual environments
 * [Done] Rackham:  Interactive session
 * [Good enough] Jupyter


## Lesson plan notes

- 10:00-10:45: Packages: 
  - Exercise 2 for HPC2N has untested TensorFlow things
  - Put learners 
- 11:00-11:15: Break
- 11:15-12:00: Isolated environments
  - Exercise 2 is UPPMAX only
  - Exercises 2.4 and 3.4 take 6 and 13 minutes
- 12:00-13:00: Lunch break
- 13:30-13:45: UPPMAX-only
  - Interactive: only 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.5
  - Jupyter: only show and run





























## Discussion

### Pre-requirements

I feel the pre-requirements page, https://uppmax.github.io/R-python-julia-HPC/prereqs.html, is too extensive.
I feel it should link to regular documentation and mostly show
how to determine you fulfilled all pre-requirements.

## Interactive

The session on starting an interactive session feels too fancy twice:
- create an interactive session 
  - with 1 node
  - with more nodes <--- feels beyond the teaching goals
- run 2 Python scripts, 1 of which is unsuitable for an interactive session
  with more nodes.

I think, for 15 minutes, one can only do 1 node and no Python script,
to achieve the teaching goals.

## Impressed by Birgitte

I think it was impressive that Birgitte logs in into both clusters at the start.
I want that too!

## Why ssh `-Y`

Unrelated to the course, Birgitte does so.

## Loading Python

If the session is about loading Python,
maybe seeing module dependencies can removed.

Also, don't care about python3?

Also, don't care about IPython?

## Suggest to Arvid

The Bianca portal is great. Could you do the same for Rackham?
Not every user understands one needs to use 2FA now, and how

## Technical problems

This was quite annoying. Due to this, I cannot see how much the 
learners have understood and progressed through the exercises.

## More time for sbatch

There was no time for an exercise.

I would have enjoy to be sure that the learners have been able
to submit a job and see the results.

## More time for GPU

There was no time for an exercise.

## More time for UPPMAX interactive and Jupyter

There was no time for an exercise.

## Parallel programming

I feel that making a script suitable (with `**FIX**` in it) 
for a parallel run is at the 'Synthesis' level of Blooms taxonomy.
I feel that some levels lower, e.g. 'Apply' with a step-by-step
guide would be more suitable.
