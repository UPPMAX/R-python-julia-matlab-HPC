## Preparation

Here is the current state of my sessions:

Time  | Topic                   | State
------|-------------------------|------
10:00 | Introduction            | 10/10
10:10 | Syllabus                | 7/10
10:20 | Load modules and run    | 7/10
14:30 | Simultaneous session    | Done
16:00 | Summary and evaluation  | Done

In general:

- Go through the material
- Do the exercises for all centers
- Check the exercise by creating a video per center

Let's do this. 

Also:

- [x] Document how to get and extract the tarbal

Last session:

Time  | Topic                   | State
------|-------------------------|------
10:00 | Introduction            | Done
10:10 | Syllabus                | Done
10:20 | Load modules and run    | 7/10
14:30 | Simultaneous session    | Done
16:00 | Summary and evaluation  | Done

Currently, my sessions have two setups:

![](tab_look.png)

> The tab look

![](dropdown_look.png)

> The dropdown look

Today I feel the dropdown look to be cleaner,
as it preserves vertical space better,
so I'll use that one instead.
I do want to change the colors of the admonition per HPC center :-)

- [ ] change the colors of the admonition per HPC center
    - I gave up here

Videos are done, so the material is finished.

TODO:

- [x] Fix layout
- [x] Fix `module load ... R/4.2.1 R/4.2.1`
- [x] Fix mermaid graphs to match the exercise
- [x] Fix mermaid graphs to remove the command it shows,
  especial 'Load an R package library' is confusing (in an earlier
  mermaid version, one could add a newline before `library`)
- [x] Remove `module avail`, as it is not a learning objective
- [x] Check and prepare Priors

I don't like my course material. It makes me
lecture yoo much and I know I should not. Next course iteration,
I will be pointing to the centers' documentation more.
I did not make the time to properly do this, mostly
to take it easier on myself after some ruthless days of preparing
the Python session.

- [ ] Next course iteration: make 'Load and run R' point to documentation more

What does need to be done:

- [x] Make summary match evaluation
